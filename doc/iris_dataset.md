## Background

### Data Collection and Publication

The data in the Iris dataset was originally collected by botanist Edgar Anderson to study morphological variations in the Iris species of flowers, more specifically the _Iris setosa_, _Iris versicolor_, and _Iris virginica_ in the Gaspe Peninsula. Dr. Ronald A. Fisher first introduced the data in a paper from 1936 titled, "_The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems_."

Fisher used Anderson's data to illustrate a multivariate discriminant-analysis approach in order to find linear combinations of measurements that best discriminate among the species. It is appropriate to therefore credit Anderson for the dataset and Fisher for the statistical analysis.
